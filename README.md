Mall customers dataset:
Genre:
This column represents the gender of the mall customers. It can have two possible values, typically 'Male' or 'Female', indicating the gender of the individual.
Age:
The 'Age' column contains the age of each mall customer. It is a numerical value that represents the customer's age in years. The age of the customers is used to segment and analyze different age groups for targeted marketing and understanding customer preferences based on age.
Annual Income (k$):
The 'Annual Income' column represents the annual income of each mall customer in thousands of dollars (k$). This is a numerical feature that reflects the customer's earning capacity or purchasing power.
Spending Score (1-100):
The 'Spending Score' column is a numerical attribute that quantifies the spending behavior of each mall customer on a scale from 1 to 100. The score is calculated based on various factors, such as the amount spent, frequency of visits, and types of purchases made. Higher scores indicate higher spending tendencies and vice versa.

The combination of these columns in the dataset allows mall owners and marketers to perform various analyses to understand customer behavior and preferences. For instance, they can identify high-income individuals with high spending scores, specific age groups with certain spending patterns, or explore the relationship between age, income, and spending behavior to develop targeted marketing strategies. Additionally, this dataset can be used for customer segmentation, which can help tailor marketing campaigns and improve overall customer satisfaction.
